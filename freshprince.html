            <h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
            <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
                where in my youth I'd play upon the green
                'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
                by ruffians contemptible and mean.
                Although the spat was trivial and brief,
                it wounded my dear mother deep within;
                and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
                she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
                When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
                I came upon a coachman most unique;
                and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
                despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
                I survey all the land with princely mien
                in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.

            <h1>Where The Bee Sucks</h1>
            <p>WHERE the bee sucks, there suck I:   
                In a cowslip's bell I lie;  
                There I couch when owls do cry. 
                On the bat's back I do fly. 
                After summer merrily:
                Merrily, merrily, shall I live now
                Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

            <h1>From The Rape Of Lucrece</h1>
            <p>
                Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
                Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
                Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
                Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
                Between whose hills her head entombed is;
                Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
                To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.

                Without the bed her other fair hand was,
                On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
                Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
                With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
                Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
                And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
                Till they might open to adorn the day.

                Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
                O modest wantons, wanton modesty!
                Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
                And death's dim look in life's mortality.
                Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
                As if between them twain there were no strife,
                But that life lived in death, and death in life.

                Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,
                A pair of maiden worlds unconquerèd,
                Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
                And him by oath they truly honourèd.
                These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,
                Who like a foul usurper went about
                From this fair throne to heave the owner out.

                What could he see but mightily he noted?
                What did he note but strongly he desired?
                What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
                And in his will his willful eye he tired.
                With more than admiration he admired
                Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
                Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.

                As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey
                Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
                So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
                His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
                Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
                His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
                Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.

                And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
                Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.
                In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
                Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,
                Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
                Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
                Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.

                His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
                His eye commends the leading to his hand;
                His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
                Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand
                On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,
                Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
                Left their round turrets destitute and pale.

                They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
                Where their dear governess and lady lies,
                Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
                And fright her with confusion of their cries.
                She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,
                Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
                Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.

                Imagine her as one in dead of night
                From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
                That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
                Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.
                What terror ‘tis! but she, in worser taking,
                From sleep disturbèd, heedfully doth view
                The sight which makes supposèd terror true.

                Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,
                Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
                She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
                Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.
                Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries,
                Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
                In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.

                His hand, that yet remains upon her breast
                (Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)
                May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,
                Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
                Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
                This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
                To make the breach and enter this sweet city.

            <h1>Helen's Soliloqy (All's Well That Ends Well) </h1>
            <p>
                Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
                Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
                Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
                Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
                What power is it which mounts my love so high,
                That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
                The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
                To join like likes and kiss like native things.
                Impossible be strange attempts to those
                That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
                What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
                To show her merit that did miss her love? 
            <p/>

        <li>
            <h1>The Passionate Pilgrim</h1>
            <p>
                When my love swears that she is made of truth,
                I do believe her, though I know she lies,
                That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
                Unskilful in the world's false forgeries,
                Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
                Although I know my years be past the best,
                I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,
                Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
                But wherefore says my love that she is young?
                And wherefore say not I that I am old?
                O, love's best habit is a soothing tongue,
                And age, in love, loves not to have years told.
                Therefore, I'll lie with love, and love with me,
                Since that our faults in love thus smother'd be.
